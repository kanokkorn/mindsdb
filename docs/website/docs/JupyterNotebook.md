title: Running on Jupyter Notebook

## Create a notebook

Go here - https://jupyter.org/

Click on the Link ‘Try it in your browser!’ https://jupyter.org/try

Click the top left tile ‘Try Jupyter with Python!’ https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython/ipython-in-depth/master?filepath=binder/Index.ipynb

You’ll see a screen load with ‘Binder’ at the top.  This should resolve to a screen, with a file menu near the top.

On the far left to the file menu, select file, then drag down ‘New Notebook’ and from there select ‘Python 3’.

You will then see Python command line

## Installing mindsdb and running

In the command line type: `!pip install git+https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb.git@master --user --no-cache-dir --upgrade --force-reinstall;` then press the `Run` button in the top bar and wait for the install to finish.

Now we can run one of our mindsdb examples, first by training a model:

```python

import mindsdb

# Instantiate a mindsdb Predictor
mdb = mindsdb.Predictor(name='real_estate_model')

# We tell the Predictor what column or key we want to learn and from what data
mdb.learn(
    from_data="https://s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/mindsdb-example-data/home_rentals.csv", # the path to the file where we can learn from, (note: can be url)
    to_predict='rental_price', # the column we want to learn to predict given all the data in the file
)

```

Then generating some predictions:

```python
mdb = mindsdb.Predictor(name='real_estate_model')

# use the model to make predictions
# Note: you can use the `when_data` argument if you want to use a file with one or more rows instead of a python dictionary
result = mdb.predict(when={'number_of_rooms': 2,'number_of_bathrooms':1, 'sqft': 1190})

# The result will be an array containing predictions for each data point (in this case only one), a confidence for said prediction and a few other extra informations
print('The predicted price is ${price} with {conf} confidence'.format(price=result[0]['rental_price'], conf=result[0]['rental_price_confidence']))
```
